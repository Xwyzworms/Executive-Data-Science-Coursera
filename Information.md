# Crash Course On Data Science 
Taught By : 
* Jeff Leek ,PHD 
* Brian Caffo,PHD
* Roger D Peng,PHD

Purpose Of the Course : 
This one-module course constitutes the first "week" of the Executive Data Science Specialization. 
This is an intensive introduction to what you need to know about data science itself. 
You'll learn important terminology and how successful organizations use data science.

**DISCLAIMER** --> 
*If you Want to copy paste My word ,it's fine tho ,because your 
writing skill and thinking skill will not grow :D , better to make this reference .

BOOK In this Specialization
* Executive Data Science: A Guide to Training and Managing the Best Data Scientists 
  * Written By the lecturer , it's free and available on kindle.

## What you'll get from this Course 
* Understand definition of Data Science :
  * learning from data through a lot of pain , for short.
* Understand The Statistic Skill you need to Understand :
  * Descriptive Statistics (Basic Data Summaries, EDA , ect)
  * Inference Statistics (Confidence Interval , Population conclusion , Hypothesist Tests)
  * Prediction  (Guess an outcome / output using a model and evaluate model)
  * Experimental Design (Make Your model general and having a good prediction on unseen Data)
*  Understand The Machine Learning the basic characteristic and traditional statistics
  * Supervised Learning (Include Labels)
    * Random Forest
    * Linear Regression
    * SVM
    * Neural Network
  * Unsupervised Learning (Not include labels)
    * PCA
    * Factor Analysis
    * K-means
    * Hieraical Clustering
  * Unfortunately , this class only covers the Supervised Learning Characteristic:
    * Emphasis on prediction / focus on prediction
    * Evaluating result via prediction perfomance
    * Concern with overfitting not model complexity
    * Focus on perfomance
    * Obtaining Generalizability (Good act on unseen data)
    * Concern over perfomance and robustness
   * Traditional Statistics
    * Focusing on hypothesis
    * Simple model not complex model
    * Having Concern over assumptions and robustness
    * Having Statistical Modeling or sampling assumption that connect data to a population of interest
    * Focus on parameter interpretability
  * Understand The Software Engineering for Data science
    * Generalize data anaylyses into software ,CONFUSE ? Below is the point
        * Write some code in some sort of function and release it of course documented well and easy to use
  * Understand The Stucture of a Data Science Project 
    * *Iterative Process
    * Ask A Question , What kind of Questions ? SPECIFIC and Concrete Questions,not Vague.
    * Ask The Data , What kind of Questions ? Data Privacy , Data Legalicy ,Data policy and ect
    * E D A , Whoops you need to know your data go perform de EDA
    * Modeling , Build up your Model algo ,see if that help you answer the question you ask
    * Interpretation , Interpret your model and your findings and build up the final result 
    * Communication , 1 more painful way , present the findings .Could be with data scientist again or with many audience,make sure you dont have "Kernel Panic"
    * DECISION ((( OPTIONAL ))) Based on your Organization
    
    * TIPS FOR EDA --> If you done your analyses ,back again and ask another question,assume you dont know anything about the data.
  * Understand The Output of Data science Experiment 
    * It Depends ,those are:
      * Reports
       * Reports is the most common output of data science experiment,Report Should consist:
        * Be clearly written
        * involve a narrative around the data
        * Discuss the creation of the analytic dataset
        * Have concise conclusions
        * Omit unnecessary details
        * Reproducible {Well Documented Code}
      * Presentations
      * Interactive Web Pages
      * APPS
 * Tools For Data Science
  * Willingness
  * Hardwork
  * SmartWork
  * Problem Solving
  * Math and stats
  * STACK OVER FLOW
  * BOOKS
  * Visualization product (Tableu) i use tableau
  * Programming language (R / Python ) I use Both
  * SQL
  * Databases
  * Version control (Github/bitBucket) I use Github ,lol
  * Additional Tools / packages .
 * How to Success In data Science ?
  * The key idea is ,You learned from data such as:
   * New Knowledge Created
   * Decision or policies are made based on the outcome of the experiment
   * Well known the data .
 * For me that the fundamental things i get :D ,HOPE You enjoy reading this WHOLE Bunch words .
